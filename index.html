        <p>hope this freaking works</p>
        <p>It did work! Now adding a branch</p>
        <p>now styling to see if I can add a new file (css) to my code and get it onto github via command line with git add</p>
        <p>that worked</p>
        <p>let's add some snow w javascript</p>
        <p>yay</p>
        <p>now using git add on the command line to add the js file to github</p>
        <p>worked. now trying to make a branch for the first time</p>
        <p>something went horribly wrong. I tried to git commit -m and git push origin and git checkout main and git pull..... and all my code was deleted from vscode. </p>
        <p> So I've pasted it back in</p>
